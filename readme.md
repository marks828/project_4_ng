1. I should be able to see all the bets, how much the bet is, and who won
2. I should be able to create new bets
3. I should be able to see every individual app and other information
4. I should be able to edit the bet

#Technologies used
I used a Rails backend and an Angular front end. I ran my styling through SASS.

#Future implementation
I would like to be able to keep track of who makes the bet, who is a part of the bet and how much money everyone is owed.
